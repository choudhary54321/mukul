    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>All sporting endeavors share the concept of excelling in one's physical abilities, as well as the need for rules to establish a fair context for performance.  The British have led the way in setting sports rules while modern performance measurement methods have prompted the development of detailed record keeping systems.  The modern Olympic games movement has contributed importantly to popularize a variety of sports, and the emergence of professional sports, along with today's media, have driven impressive growth in sport's social and economic impacts.

        Today, sports are a cultural phenomenon which transcend national borders, as sporting event gate receipts are increasingly supplemented by financing from media rights and sponsorships.</h2>
        <h1>Team Sports</h1>
        

        <h2>A team sport is one in which one group of people (a team) opposes another group of people with the common goal of achieving victory.  Team sports differ from individual sports, where victory is achieved through individual merit rather than teamwork.

            Team sports are popular throughout the world on both professional and recreational levels.  The team sport of baseball is considered "America's pastime" and garners a large number of amateur players and spectators, along with football and basketball.  Lacrosse is considered the "Canadian national game" and ice hockey is also a very popular sport in Canada.  Soccer is the most popular team sport in Latin America and many other parts of the world.  Other team sports include field hockey and volleyball.  Some sports and athletic events such as swimming, skiing, and track and field can be considered individual and/or team sports depending on the type of competition.</h2>
